Developing a Web Crawler
This assignment requires you to develop a topical/focused crawler to crawl 500 pages, for a topic of your choice, from Wikipedia. 
You need to specify: 
1) the topic, 
2) at least 10 related terms (could be single words or phrases), and 
3) at least 2 seed URLs.  
In the crawling process, you need to determine whether a page is relevant to the topic: checking 
whether it contains at least 2 related terms that you specified, before saving it into the crawled collection   
The page-relevance checking process should be case-insensitive. 

 

For example, if the topic is “Information Retrieval”, 
the seed URLs can be: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval and 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_(computing).

 

Example related terms for the topic “information retrieval” might be:
 Information Retrieval, Crawler, Search Engine, tf-idf, Mean Average Precision, Precision, Recall, Relevance Feedback,
 Query Expansion, Retrieval Models, Boolean Model, Vector Space Model, and Language Model.
